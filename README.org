* This is the initial commit

** What's still coming
- apparently there is a linker error, that happens when compiling the
  counting qfilter tests
- we will add the scripts used for testing/creating the plots in our
  paper
- some more cleanup of the benchmark code (only readability)
- some more cleanup involving the utils folder
- some examples, of how to use the data structures

** What's already here
- there are three variants of our data structures (described [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08374][here]])
  - once as described in the paper
  - once basically the same but with a templated number of remainder
    bits (this might be faster when the necessary false positive rate
    is known at compile time)
  - once without the grouped remainders described in the paper

- some benchmarks used to create the plots in the paper

** How to use what's there
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
#+END_SRC

- Currently there seems to be a linking error connected to the cqf
  implementation
- Our implementation might need a compiler greater than gcc 7.4.0 we
  have had some problems with an internal compiler bug at version
  7.4.0
